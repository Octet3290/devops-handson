This project automates the deployment of an AWS-based application that reads data from an S3 bucket and pushes it to an RDS database using a Python-based Lambda function. All infrastructure is managed using Terraform, and the application is containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
